**Facebook Page Comment Moderation Scoreboard → Team Report**
=========================================================================================

This workflow automatically monitors Facebook Page comments, analyzes them using AI for intent, toxicity, and spam, stores moderation results in a database, and sends a clear summary report to Slack and Telegram.

---

**1.2 Summary (TL;DR)**
-----------------------

This workflow runs every few hours to fetch Facebook Page comments and analyze them using OpenAI. Each comment is classified as positive, neutral, or negative, checked for toxicity, spam, and abusive language, and then stored in Supabase. A simple moderation summary is sent to Slack and Telegram.

You receive:

* **Automated Facebook comment moderation**
* **AI-based intent, toxicity, and spam detection**
* **Database logging of all moderated comments**
* **Clean Slack & Telegram summary reports**

Ideal for teams that want visibility into comment quality without manually reviewing every message.
